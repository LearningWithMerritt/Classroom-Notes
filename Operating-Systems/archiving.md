Archive Files

An archive file is a single file that contains one or more other files, often in a compressed format. 
Archive files are used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage.

File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file without losing any of its essential information. 
This can be done using a variety of algorithms that work by identifying and removing redundant data from the file.

Common Archive File Types:
.zip      - Zip Archive is the most common archive file format and is supported by all major operating systems.
.rar      - Roshal ARchive archive file format that offers better compression than ZIP, but it is not as widely supported.
.7z       - 7-Zip Archive is a newer archive file format that offers better compression than RAR, but is less widely supported.
.tar      - Tape ARchive is an archive file format that is commonly used on Unix-like systems. 
            It is not compressed by default, but it can be used with compression tools such as gzip or bzip2.
.tar.gz   - Tape ARchive GZipped is a compressed TAR archive that uses the gzip compression algorithm.
.tar.bz2  - Tape ARchive BZipped2 is a compressed TAR archive that uses the bzip2 compression algorithm. 
.jar      - Java ARchive is an archive file format that is used to package Java applications.
