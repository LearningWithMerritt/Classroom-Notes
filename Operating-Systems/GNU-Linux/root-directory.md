Linux Distributions will contain, most if not all of these directories in the root directory. 



/       : (root) contains all other directories, their subdirectories, and files.


/bin    : (binaries) contains command binaries or the commands you run in linux.

/boot   : contains files the system needs to boot.

/cdrom  : (compact disk read only memory) mount point for CD-ROMs

/dev    : (devices) consists of files that represent the devices that are attached to the local system,

/etc    : (pronounced et-see) or (etcetera) is the directory where linux system configuration files live.

/home   : where the folders for the users on the system are kept.

/lib    : where shared library files are stored that are required for system boot. 
          Library files are typically dependencies for specific commands or software.



/lib32  : (library) directory for software using the x86 instruction set. 

/lib64  : (library) directory for software using the x86-64 instruction set.

/libx32 : (library) directory for software using the x86-64 instruction set but with the 32-bit point size. 

/media  : where external removable devices such as USB drives are mounted.

/mnt    : (mount) temporary mount point for regular file systems like old school floppy disks and CD-ROMs. 

/opt    : (optional) where optional files such as third-party tools are saved. 

/proc   : (processes)contains information specific to the processes on the system, and 
          contains files that represent the current state of the kernel. 

/root   : home directory for the root (admin) user.

/run    : stores volatile runtime data such as info about the running system since last boot: 
          currently logged-in users and running daemons. 

/sbin   : (super user binaries)  that contains root(admin) binaries. These are super user commands.

/srv    : (service) contains server specific and service related files. 

/sys    : (system) interface to the kernel that acts as a virtual filesystem. 
          It stores and allows for changing devices connected to the system.  

/tmp    : (temporary) where temporary files are a stored and will typically be deleted upon system boot. 
          (However files can be deleted at other times without warning.)

/usr    : (User System Resources) contains all the user binaries, their documentation(man pages),  libraries, header files, etc.

/var    : (variable) where files that are likely to change(log files,web files,email,cron files,etc.) are stored. Data is typically written here.


/home/<USER>/Desktop   : contains shortcuts, files and folders that you use frequently

/home/<USER>/Documents : stores personal documents

/home/<USER>/Downloads : stores downloaded files and directories

/home/<USER>/Music     : stores music

/home/<USER>/Pictures  : stores pictures
