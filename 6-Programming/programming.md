# `Terms`

## `Code Types`

| Term                           | Definition |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Source Code** | The original, human-readable code written by programmers before it is compiled or interpreted. |
| **Byte Code** | A form of intermediate code that is executed by a virtual machine, such as Java bytecode running on the JVM. |
| **Machine Code** | A set of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that a computer's CPU can execute directly. |

<br>

## `Language Types`

| Term                           | Definition |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Declarative Programming Languages** | Programming languages that describe what the program should accomplish rather than explicitly defining how to do it. Examples include SQL and HTML. |
| **Procedural Programming Languages** | Programming languages that follow a step-by-step procedure to execute commands. Examples include C, Pascal, and Python. |
| **High-Level Languages** | Programming languages that are closer to human language, making them easier to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, and C++. |
| **Low-Level Languages** | Programming languages that are closer to machine language, providing more control over hardware. Examples include Assembly and Machine Code. |
| **Compiled Languages** | Languages that require a compiler to convert source code into machine code before execution. Examples include C, C++, and Rust. |
| **Interpreted Languages** | Languages that are executed line by line at runtime by an interpreter. Examples include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. |

## `Common Languages`

| Term                           | Definition |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| **C** | A low-level, procedural programming language that provides direct access to memory and hardware, commonly used for system programming and embedded systems. |
| **C++** | An extension of C with object-oriented features, widely used in game development, system software, and performance-critical applications. |
| **C#** | A high-level, object-oriented language developed by Microsoft, commonly used in enterprise applications, game development (Unity), and Windows applications. |
| **Rust** | A systems programming language focused on memory safety, concurrency, and performance, often used in low-level software development and operating systems. |
| **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)** | A markup language used to structure web pages and their content using elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. |
| **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** | A stylesheet language used to control the appearance of HTML elements, defining styles like colors, fonts, and layout. |
| **JavaScript (JS)** | A programming language used to add interactivity to web pages, such as dynamic content updates and animations. |
| **Python** | A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity, widely used in web development, data science, and automation. |
| **Java** | A high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language designed for cross-platform compatibility, often used in enterprise applications and Android development. |
