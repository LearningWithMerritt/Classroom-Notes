# `File Extensions`

A `file extension` is a suffix that is added to the end of a filename to indicate the type of file. 
        It is typically separated from the rest of the filename by a period (.)

*In Windows file extensions are required, but often hidden by the file explorer.*

*In GNU/Linux systems file extensions are not required, but are often used by convention to help users identify file contents.*
