# `C:\Users`


Type 'cd ~' in the terminal to visit your home directory.
In Windows, the 'Users' directory is a key part of the filesystem hierarchy.
It is located at 'C:\\Users' by default and contains individual directories for each user account.

Key Points about the 'Users' Directory:

1. User Directories:
   Each user account on the system has a corresponding directory within the 'Users' folder.
   These directories typically have names corresponding to the usernames. For example:
   - 'C:\\Users\\Default': A default profile used when creating new user accounts.
   - 'C:\\Users\\Public': A public profile that provides access to common files for all users.
   - 'C:\\Users\\YourUsername': A personal directory for the individual user 'YourUsername'.

2. User Profile Contents:
   Each user's directory contains personal files and folders, including:
   - 'Desktop': Contains files and shortcuts that appear on the user's desktop.
   - 'Documents': A folder for storing documents and other personal files.
   - 'Downloads': The default folder for files downloaded from the internet.
   - 'Pictures': A folder for storing image files.
   - 'Videos': A folder for storing video files.
   - 'AppData': A hidden folder for application-specific data, including settings and cache.

3. Special Folders:
   - 'Default': This is a template profile used by the system when creating new user accounts.
   - 'Public': Contains files and folders accessible by all users of the computer.

4. Access Permissions:
   Each user's directory is generally accessible only by the respective user and system administrators.
   The permissions ensure privacy and security of user data.
