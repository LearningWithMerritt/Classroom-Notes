Transmission Characteristics

`Bandwidth` is the theoreticaly amount of data that could be transmitted during a given period of time through a given medium.

`Throughput` aka payload rate or effective data rate is the measure of how much actual data is transmitted during a given period of time through a medium.


`Bit rate` is the rate of data transmission expressed in bits transmitted per second.
* `Bits per second` or `bps`
* Standard metric prefixes can be applied. 


| Prefix | Name      | Abbreviation | Power of 10 | Value in bps           |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| (none) | Bit       | bps          | 10⁰         | 1 bps                   |
| kilo   | Kilobit   | kbps         | 10³         | 1,000 bps               |
| mega   | Megabit   | Mbps         | 10⁶         | 1,000,000 bps           |
| giga   | Gigabit   | Gbps         | 10⁹         | 1,000,000,000 bps       |
| tera   | Terabit   | Tbps         | 10¹²        | 1,000,000,000,000 bps   |


Important NOTE:
In data storage bytes(B) and binary prefixes are used 2<sup>n</sup>. eg. KB is 2<sup>10</sup> bytes or 1024 bytes.
In data transmission bits (b) and decimal prefixes are used 10<sup>n</sup>. eg. Kbps is 10<sup>3</sup> bits per second or 1000 bits per second.


`Noise` degrades and distorts signals on a network and is measured in decibels dB
Common Sources of noise:
* `Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)`
    * `Radio Frequency Interference RFI` is a type of EMI caused by radio waves. EMI is sometimes refered to as EMI/RFI.
    * Motors, power lines, televisions, copiers, fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, manufacturing machines, thunderstorms, and othe source of electrical activity can cause EMI
    * Strong radio broadcast signals from radio or TV antennas can generate RFI.
* `Crosstalk` occurs when a signal from one wire crosses to another wire or cable.
    * Alien crosstalk occurs between two cables
    * NEXT (near end crosstalk) occurs between wire pairs near the source of a signal
    * FEXT (far end crosstalk) occurs between wire pairs at the far end of the cable from the signal source. 

Noise is unaviodable, but can be minimized and overcome.

`Attenuation` is the loss of a signal's strength as it travels away from its source.
