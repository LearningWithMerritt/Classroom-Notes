Linux Command Line

Console: physical device that provides a text-based interface to a computer. 
It is typically a monitor and keyboard.

Command line: text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer by typing in commands. 
It is the oldest and most basic type of user interface.

Shell: program that interprets commands entered by the user at the command line. 
It is responsible for executing the commands and displaying the results to the user.

Linux has multiple shells that can be used, but the default shell is bash. 
The Bash shell (Bourne-Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project 
    as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. 
First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. 
Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to Linux, alongside GCC.

Bash is also a popular programming language for writing shell scripts. 
Shell scripts are text files that contain a series of commands that are executed by the Bash shell. 
Shell scripts can be used to automate tasks, such as backing up files, installing software, or deploying a web application.

Terminal: software application that provides a command line interface. 
It is often used to access and manage servers, but it can also be used on desktop computers.

Prompt: symbol or sequence of symbols that appears at the command line, indicating that the system is ready to receive a command.
The prompt typically looks like a dollar sign ($) or greater than sign (>).


A CLI command is typically made up of the following parts:

Command name: 
    This is the name of the command that you want to execute.

Flags: 
    optional parameters, but they are typically used to enable or disable certain features of the command.

Arguments: 
    optional parameters that you can use to modify the behavior of the command.
