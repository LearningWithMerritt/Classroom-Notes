# `Windows Software Installation`

There are two main types of files that are used to install software on Windows:

|Extension| Description|
|:-:|:-|
|`.msi`| MSI files, or Windows Installer packages, are the most common type of file used to install software on Windows. MSI files contain a database that contains all of the information needed to install the software. This includes the program files, registry settings, and shortcuts.|
|`.exe`| EXE files, or executable files, are also used to install software on Windows.  EXE files are not as reliable as MSI files because they do not use a database to track the installation process.  If the installation is interrupted for any reason, the EXE file may not be able to resume the installation from where it left off.|

|`.msp`| MSP files, or Windows Installer patch files, are used to update or modify existing MSI packages.|
|`.mst`| MST files, or Windows Installer transform files, are used to customize the installation of MSI packages.|
