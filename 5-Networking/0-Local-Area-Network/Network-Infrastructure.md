    TIA/EIA-568
    structured cabling

Entrance Facility is the location where an incoming network connects with a school or corporate network.

Demarcation point (demarc) the point of division between a telecommunications service carriers network and a buildings internal network.

Main distribution frame or main distribution facility (MDF) aka Main cross-connect (MC) is the centralized point of interconnection for an organization's LAN or WAN. Refers to racks holding networking equipment in practice.

Data room aka Data closet, data center, equipment room, or telecommunications room and holds networking equipment. 

Racks

Patch Panel is a panel of data receptors which can be mounted toa wall or rack and provides a central termination point when many patch cables converge in a single location. 


Voice over IP VoIP aka IP Telephony used to carry voice signals using TCP/IP protocols.
* VoIP gateway device converts signals from a analog phone equipment into IP data that can travel over the Internet, or that converts VoIP data from and interal IP network to travel over a phone company's analog telephone lines.
* VoIP PBX private branch exchange is a dedicated phone switch or virtual switching device that connects and manages calls within a private organization and manages call connections that exit the network through a VoIP Gateway.
* VoIP Endpoint is a end user device or application that give the user access to VoIP services on a network. 

`Intermediate Distribution Frames IDF` is a junction point between the MDF and the concentrations of fewer connections it provides and intermediate connection between the MDF and the end-user equipment on each floor and in each building.

Work area is the area encompasses workstations, printers, and other network devices.

Wall Jacks, TIA/EIA standard includes one voice and one data outlet.




CABLING:
Patch Cable: a short (3-25ft) length of cabling with connectors at both ends

Horizontal Cabling connects workstations to the closest data room and switches in that room. Max distance (100m)
* TIA/EIA Recognizes 3 possible cable types UTP STP or Fiber Optic
    * Unsheilded twisted pair UTP
    * Shielded twisted pair STP
    * Fiber Optic

Backbone Cabling consists of cables or wireless links that provide interconnection between the entrance facility and MDF, and between the MDF and IDFs.
