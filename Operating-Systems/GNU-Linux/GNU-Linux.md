An OS is made of:
Kernel--> Shell--> User Interface --> Applications

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an 
operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

GNU/Linux is a term used by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to refer to the operating system 
that combines the GNU operating system with the Linux kernel. 

The FSF argues that the Linux kernel is only one component of a complete operating system, and that the GNU Project has contributed many more essential components, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),the GNU C Library (glibc), and the GNU Bash shell.

Linux distributions are operating systems made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, 
and often a package management system. 

A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet many users' needs.


Open source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.

Some popular Linux distributions include:

Ubuntu
Debian
Fedora
Mint
Manjaro
OpenSUSE
Elementary OS
Pop!_OS
