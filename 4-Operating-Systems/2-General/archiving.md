# `Archive Files`

An `archive file` is a single file that contains one or more other files, often in a compressed format. 
Archive files are used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage.

`File compression` is the process of reducing the size of a file without losing any of its essential information. 
This can be done using a variety of algorithms that work by identifying and removing redundant data from the file.
