# `Files`


A `file` is a collection of data that is stored on a computer storage device.
* Files can contain any type  of data, such as text, images, videos, music, and programs. 

* Files are identified by their `filename`, which is a unique name that is assigned to the file when it is created. 

* Files are organized into `folders (directories)`, which are containers that can contain other files and folders.

# `File Extensions`

A `file extension` is a suffix that is added to the end of a filename to indicate the type of data the file stores. 
syntax:
```
<filename>.<extension>
```
example
```
file.txt
```

# `Windows File Paths`

A `file path` is a string of characters that identifies the location of a file on a computer storage device. 

`C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop`

`File paths` in Windows are typically composed of a drive letter (C), a volume separator(:), a directory structure (separated with backslashes), and/or a filename. 


| **Component**| **Description**| **Example**|
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `Drive letter`| The letter assigned to a drive (optional). | `C`, `D`, `E`|
| `Volume separator`| A colon used to separate the drive letter from the path. | `:`|
| `Directory structure` | The folders or directories leading to the file, separated by backslashes (`\`). | `\Users\John\Documents` |
| `Filename`| The name of the file (can include an extension). | `file.txt` |

<br>

Filepath examples:
```
C:\Users\John\Documents\file.txt
```
```
C:\Users\Alice\Pictures\Vacation\beach.jpg
```
```
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Reader\AcroRd32.exe
```
```
E:\Backup\2023\financial_data.xlsx
```
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```
Network filepath example:
```
\\Server\SharedFolder\Projects\Report.docx
```

# `Absolute File Paths`
File paths can be `absolute` or `relative`. 

An `absolute file path` specifies the complete location(address) of a file, starting from the root directory. 

example:
```
C:\Windows\System32
```
```
C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop\My-Folder\myfile.txt
```
```
"D:\My Documents\myfile.txt"
```
Network file path example:
```
\\SERVER\SHARE\myfile.txt
```
```
\\?\UNC\SERVER\SHARE\myfile.txt
```

# `Relative File Paths`
File paths can be `absolute` or `relative`.

A `relative file path` specifies the location of a file relative to the current working directory (current location). 

* `.` is a reference to the current working directory

* `..` is a reference to the parent directory of the current working directory

example:
```
.\myfile.txt
```
```
"..\My Documents\myfile.txt"
```
```
.\subdir\myfile.txt
```
```
..\..\..\
```
```
..\Desktop
```

# `Tips for Working with Windows File Paths`
* Use backslashes `\` to separate directory components.
```
C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop\My-Folder\myfile.txt
```

<br> 

* Enclose file paths in double quotes if they contain spaces.
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

<br>

* To use a relative file path, start with a period `.` to indicate the current working directory or `..` to indicate the parent directory.
