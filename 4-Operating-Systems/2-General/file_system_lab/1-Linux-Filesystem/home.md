# `/home`

In Linux, the 'home' directory is a special directory that stores personal files and settings
for each user on the system. It is located at '/home/$USER', where '$USER' represents the name
of the current user.

Key Points about the 'Home' Directory:

1. Location:
   The 'home' directory is typically found at '/home', and each user has a subdirectory within it.
   For example, a user named 'john' will have their files located at '/home/john'.

2. Purpose:
   The 'home' directory serves as the main workspace for users, containing their personal files,
   settings, and data. It is where users store documents, downloads, and application configuration files.

3. Contents:
   A typical 'home' directory contains various subdirectories, including:
   - **Desktop:** Files and shortcuts visible on the user's desktop.
   - **Documents:** Personal documents and files.
   - **Downloads:** Files downloaded from the internet.
   - **Pictures:** Images and photo collections.
   - **Music:** Audio files and music collections.
   - **Videos:** Video files and media content.
   - **.config and .local:** Hidden directories that store application settings and user-specific configurations.

4. Permissions:
   Each user's 'home' directory is generally only accessible by that user and the system administrator.
   This ensures privacy and separation of data between users on the same machine.

5. Example Path:
/home/$USER

Summary:
The 'home' directory in Linux is the central location for a user's personal files and settings.
It provides a private workspace for each user, ensuring a structured and organized environment
for managing personal data.
